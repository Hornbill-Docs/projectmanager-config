# Project Tags
Introduction Project Tags allow you to categorize each project by applying one or more relevent tags

## Creating Project Tags
Users with the **Project Administrator** role will see a new menu options **Tags**, from here it is possible to create new, edit existing, add translations and remove project tags.
  
  
### Adding Tags to the Tag Cloud
To create a new tag, simply type the tag name into the input field and press the Add Tag button. 

The new tag will be added to the tag cloud displayed below. 

  
### Adding Tag Translations

To add a new translation for a tag, select it from the list, using the **edit** icon to the right, this will open a popup dialog. 

* From there, select the language that you wish to translate the tag to and click the 'Translate' button. You can manually adjust the translated value before accepting it.
* All translations of the tag are displayed in the table.
* Add tag translations for the tag in all available languages that your Hornbill instance supports.
  
  
### Managing Existing Tags

* Update the name of the existing tag.
* Tags can only be removed if they are not associated to any projects.
* Change the language to view tags that have been translated into different languages.

## Using Tags

Once tags have been added, project users can add these tags to their projects via the **Project Tags** tab on each project

## Viewing Projects By Tags

Once Projects have been assigned tags, you can view all projects which carry the tags from the **Project Portfolio** view
