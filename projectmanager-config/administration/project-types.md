# Project Types
Introduction Different types of projects exist and may have differing characteristics, underlying processes and requirements. In order to cater for this, it is possible when creating a new **Project** to assign it a specific type of project. 

## Create and Manage Project Types
You can create one or more **Project Types** and attribute them the following attributes by selecting the **+** icon

* **Name**

The name for the type of project

* **Description**

An explanation describing the type of project

* **Business Process**

It is not mandatory to have a **Business Process** associated to a project type, but if one if required, select it from the available drop down list.

If no business process is selected, no Head's Up Display will be shown on the **Project Overview** tab on the Project

* **Status**

Each type can be in **Draft**, **Active** or **Retired** status. Only those types in an **Active** status will be available to choose when creating a new **Project**

  
When Project Manager is installed a **default** project type of **Standard Project Type** is automatically created and available, but does not have a business process associated to it. Additional **Project Type** attributes will be added in due course

## Managing Project Types

* **Edit** \- Use the pencil icon to edit the project types name, description, business process or status
* **Delete** \- Permanently delete the project type by choosing the **trash can** icon next to the project type you wish to delete
