# Workflows
A workflow can be used to define some of the more complex stages in a project. If you are planning to follow a structured Project Management process such as Prince2 or PMP, the workflows can be used to define the steps and stages to support this.

## Business Process Options
* **Suspend Project**. This will suspend the BPM as the project is worked on. The suspend is in place until the project is manually moved on by the Project Manager via the Progress icon on the Project Overview tab on a project. Initially this is a manual action which allows the Project Manager to visualize progress through the Project stages and their defined Checkpoints in each stage, allowing other Project Stakeholders to have top level visibility of the current stage, completed actions and those which are still outstanding.
* **Wait for Project Completion**. This will suspend the BPM until the project status changes to Completed.
